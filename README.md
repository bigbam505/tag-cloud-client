## About

[Tag-Cloud Client](http://github.com/bigbam505/tag-cloud-client) is a node module designed to integration with [Tag-Cloud](http://github.com/bigbam505/tag-cloud) easily.  It allows for a simple api to communicate with the external Tag-Cloud server and pull in random values.  Ideally this would be used within a campfire script to get an external value.

## Tag-Cloud Client Usage

    var client = require('tag-cloud-client');
    var TagCloud = new Client({token: 'tag-cloud-token', url: 'http://tag-cloud.domain.com/});
    TagCloud.GetRandomValue('tag-name', function(value) {
      console.log(value);
    });


## Enviromental Variables

    Optionally you can specifiy Enviromental Variables for the following values
    - TAG_CLOUD_TOKEN : The token that is set on the Tag-Cloud Server
    - TAG_CLOUD_URL : The url of the tag cloud server absent a trailing slash
